# ``verify`` is an optional param to disable SSL server authentication.
# By default, Tetration appliance dashboard IP uses self signed cert after
# deployment. Hence, ``verify=False`` might be used to disable server
# authentication in SSL for API clients. If users upload their own
# certificate to Tetration appliance (from ``Settings > Company`` Tab)
# which is signed by their enterprise CA, then server side authentication
# should be enabled.
# credentials.json looks like:
# {
#   "api_key": "<hex string>",
#   "api_secret": "<hex string>"
# }
